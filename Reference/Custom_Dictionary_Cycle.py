# Reference: Three passwords per username Cycle / Switch to next three passwords in the list after full username Cycle

# Three passwords per username Cycle
# Specific pattern for username specific rate limits
# Enable greater time duration between specific usernames
# while still cycling all passwords.
# Three password attempts at a time per username,
# Any size password list and every user:password combo will 
# be attempted.

# Example [ Pattern illustrated ]:
# user1:pass1
# user1:pass2
# user1:pass3
# user2:pass1
# user2:pass2
# user2:pass3
# user3:pass1, etc...
# ...
# user1:pass4
# user1:pass5
# user1:pass6
# user2:pass4
# user2:pass5, etc....
