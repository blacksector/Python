What is Ares?

Ares is a beautifully written open source botnet developed by SweetSoftware. Check out Ares here:

My contribution:

I'm writing a DDoS module for the botnet. So far I've finished the HTTP (LOIC emulation) and UDP Stress features.

Features to be included soon: SYN Flood, DRDoS (Portmap) and SNMP reflection.

SweetSoftware has merged the first version of the module to the Ares repository. It includes the finished HTTP stress feature.

Note of Inconsistency: 
The commands in the second version of the DDoS module differ from the commands of the first version currently found in the Ares repository.
